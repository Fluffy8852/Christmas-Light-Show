This is a Christmas Light Show that uses Home Assisiant to control my smart outlet to control 9 different zones of lights which are all scynirized to follow a songs vibe.
To recreate this there are YMAL files which you can use to copy my show setup by changing the ids of my ids to your outlets ids. 
The Automation file has a send a notifacation to a device so that device can start playing the music which I used Automate on Andoird. (https://llamalab.com/automate/)
I have left an Automate automation file change play sound block to where your music is stored/notifacation sound.

The 9 different zones are labeled on the pictured below.
